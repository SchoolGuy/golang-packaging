# Strip unneeded build dependencies
# Sometimes there're additional importpath(s) in examples/tests.
# You can usually delete the examples/tests to avoid such
# unneeded BuildRequires/Requires. If they also exists in
# productional codes, you can use this macro to strip them.
# eg: %%go_strip_builddep golang.org/x/oauth2
